Giya Compass
A Living Decision-Making & Life Guidance Platform
1. Product Overview
1.1 What Giya Compass Is
Giya Compass is a personalized, AI-powered life and career guidance platform designed to
make complex decisions easier by:
Deeply understanding the user through structured reflection
Translating uncertainty into clear, step-by-step pathways
Growing with the user over time as their goals, context, and identity evolve
Helping users see and feel their possible futures through narrative visualization
It is not a one-time recommendation engine.
It is a long-term guide.

1.2 Core Problem It Solves
Most people struggle with:
Not knowing what path to choose
Feeling overwhelmed by options
Making decisions without a clear long-term picture
Losing motivation because the future feels abstract
Giya Compass solves this by:
Structuring self-discovery
Providing grounded, realistic pathways
Continuously adapting as the user grows
Making the future emotionally tangible

2. Design Philosophy & UI Direction
2.1 NotebookLM-Inspired Interface
The UI should feel:
Calm
Intelligent
Minimal
Thought-oriented
Primary Layout:
Left panel:
User notebooks (Career, Education, Skills, Reflections)
Saved paths
Life previews
Main panel:
Conversational workspace
Structured outputs (timelines, paths, suggestions)
Right panel (optional / collapsible):
Context memory
Key assumptions
“What Giya knows about you”
This reinforces the feeling that:
“This system understands me and is thinking with me.
”
2.2 Typeform-Inspired Question Flow
The onboarding and major decision flows use:
One question per screen
Conversational tone
Progress indicators
Adaptive branching (questions change based on answers)
The user never feels like they are filling a form.
They feel like they are having a guided reflection.
3. Onboarding: The Personal Discovery Flow
3.1 Initial Entry Experience

3.3 Identity Model Creation
From these answers, the system builds a living user profile, including:

Work style
Motivational drivers
Constraints
Early hypotheses about suitable paths
This model is not static.
It is continuously updated.
4. Career Path Suggestion Engine
4.1 Initial Recommendations
Based on the identity model, Giya Compass suggests:
3–6 career paths to explore
Each with:
○
Why it fits the user
What kind of life it tends to lead to
○
Confidence level (high / medium / exploratory)
Example:
“Based on what you’ve shared, here are some paths worth considering…
”
4.2 Adaptive Follow-Up Questions
If the system detects uncertainty or missing signals, it asks targeted clarifying questions, such
as:
“Do you prefer technical depth or creative breadth?”
“Are you open to long academic paths?”
This prevents premature or shallow recommendations.
5. Path Selection & Guided Timeline Generation
5.1 Path Selection
When the user selects a path (e.g., Product Design), the system transitions from exploration to
guidance mode.
5.2 Age-Aware, Contextual Timeline
The system generates a step-by-step timeline starting from the user’s current age.
Example structure:
Age 18–22: Foundation
Recommended degree programs
Suggested majors and specializations
Example universities (localized when possible)
Key skills to focus on
Age 22–25: Skill Deepening
Entry-level roles
Internships
Portfolio-building projects
Certifications or bootcamps
Age 25–30: Growth Phase
Advanced roles
Leadership opportunities
Specialization paths
Each step answers:
What to do
Why it matters
What success looks like at that stage
6. The Living Guide System
6.1 Giya as a Long-Term Companion
Giya Compass is designed to:
Remember past decisions
Track progress
Re-evaluate paths when circumstances change
Prompt reflection at key life moments
Examples:
“You mentioned two years ago that you value creative freedom — does that still hold?”
“Your interests have shifted toward leadership. Want to revisit your path?”
6.2 Growth Checkpoints
Periodic prompts:
Annual reflections
Skill check-ins
Goal realignment sessions
This turns the platform into a personal growth record, not just a tool.
